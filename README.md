AutoDC is a framework to enable domain experts to automatically and systematically improve datasets without much coding requirement and manual process, the idea similar with AutoML (automated machine learning). 

By using the AutoML system, such as Google Cloud AutoML, domain experts only need to bring in the input data, and AutoML takes care of the manual ML processes, then produces output predictions, along with user-defined evaluation metrics. With a similar idea, AutoDC is designed for domain experts to bring in a labeled dataset, such as annotated images, to the system; AutoDC takes care of the manual data improvement processes, and produces the improved dataset, by automatically correcting the incorrect labels (with user feedbacks), detecting edge cases, and augmenting edge cases.
