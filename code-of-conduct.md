## AutoDC Community Code of Conduct 1.0


### Our Pledge

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering
an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute
through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation,
submitting pull requests, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age,
religion, or nationality.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse,
inclusive, and healthy community.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior
and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem
inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits,
code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct,
and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces including issue trackers, blogs, and any other 
communication channels used by our community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community
leaders responsible for enforcement via e-mail to the AutoDC Project Management Committee at
zac.liu AT hypergiant DOT com and sylvia.tran AT hypergiant DOT com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
